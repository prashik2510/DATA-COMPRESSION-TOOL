##This repository contains an implementation of a basic data compression algorithm known as Run-Length Encoding (RLE). RLE is one of the simplest forms of lossless data compression where consecutive identical elements (runs) are replaced by a single element followed by the number of occurrences.This technique works efficiently for data that contains many consecutive repeated characters, making it particularly useful for certain types of file formats like bitmap images or simple text strings.
